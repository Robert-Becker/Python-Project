# Python-Project
Original Code written for my university python course. These projects were created to obtain highest marks and do not necessarily represent the best solutions. 


* All assignments were created to obtain highest marks in the course based on the criteria presented and do not necessarily represent the best solutions to these problems.

*Further, we were told to put excessive comments in our code to get practice. Production code would have just enough comments to allow a fellow engineer to understand the code without overwhelming them. 

*Each project set is a week’s assignments. 
Examples: Project 1 = Week 1, Project 4 = Week 4

*Please put input files in the same folder as the python code when necessary.
